# Leetcode Solutions in Swift

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Swift. The solutions are organized by topic to make it easier to find and study specific problem-solving patterns.

## Repository Structure

The problems are categorized into different topics to make navigation and understanding easier. Each topic corresponds to a directory, and each directory contains Swift Playground files with solutions to related problems. The structure is as follows:

```
├── Array
│   ├── ProblemName1.swift
│   ├── ProblemName2.swift
│   └── ...
├── Hashmap
│   ├── ProblemName1.swift
│   ├── ProblemName2.swift
│   └── ...
├── DynamicProgramming
│   ├── ProblemName1.swift
│   ├── ProblemName2.swift
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Problem Format
Each solution file follows this structure:
```Swift
// Problem Number & Title
// Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard
// Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/...

// Time Complexity: O(...)
// Space Complexity: O(...)

class Solution {
// Solution implementation
}
```

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Topic**: Navigate to the topic directory of interest (e.g., `Array`, `Hashmap`).
2. **View Solution**: Open the Swift file corresponding to the problem.
3. **Run the Code**: Copy the solution into your Swift environment (e.g., Xcode, Swift Playgrounds) and test it with custom inputs.
4. **Practice Variants**: Modify the code or try to solve the problem independently before checking the solution.

## Contributions
